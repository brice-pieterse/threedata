# Foobar

ThreeData is my side-project JS library for creating beautiful data visualizations. At the moment, only line charts and bar charts are supported.

## Installation

ThreeData is not available as an npm package at this time. I may add it in the future as the project matures:

```bash
npm install threedata (maybe one day)
```

## Usage

```
import THREEDATA from 'threedata

# instructions will be added here

```
